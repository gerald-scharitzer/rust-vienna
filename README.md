# Rust Vienna

is a group of people who [meet periodically](https://www.meetup.com/rust-vienna/) to share their knowledge on the Rust programming language and its ecosystem.

You can find documents from our meetings in the repository [RustVienna/meetup-history](https://github.com/RustVienna/meetup-history).

In [docs](docs) (local link) you find the documents created by me.
